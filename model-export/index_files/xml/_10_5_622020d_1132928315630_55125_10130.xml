specifies the exact date and time at which the job must become a candidate
for printing.
&lt;P&gt;
If the value of this attribute specifies a date-time that is in the future,
the printer should add the {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} value of
JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED to the job's {@link JobStateReasons JobStateReasons}
attribute, must move the job to the PENDING_HELD state, and must not schedule
the job for printing until the specified date-time arrives.
&lt;P&gt;
When the specified date-time arrives, the printer must remove the {@link
JobStateReason JobStateReason} value of JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED from the
job's {@link JobStateReasons JobStateReasons} attribute, if present. If there
are no other job state reasons that keep the job in the PENDING_HELD state,
the printer must consider the job as a candidate for processing by moving the
job to the PENDING state.
&lt;P&gt;
If the specified date-time has already passed, the job must be a candidate
for processing immediately. Thus, one way to make the job immediately become
a candidate for processing is to specify a JobHoldUntil attribute constructed
like this (denoting a date-time of January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT):
&lt;PRE&gt;
JobHoldUntil immediately = new JobHoldUntil (new Date (0L));
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
If the client does not supply this attribute in a Print Request and the
printer supports this attribute, the printer must use its
(implementation-dependent) default JobHoldUntil value at job submission time
(unlike most job template attributes that are used if necessary at job
processing time).
&lt;P&gt;
To construct a JobHoldUntil attribute from separate values of the year,
month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a {@link java.util.Calendar
Calendar} object to construct a {@link java.util.Date Date} object, then use
the {@link java.util.Date Date} object to construct the JobHoldUntil
attribute. To convert a JobHoldUntil attribute to separate values of the
year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a {@link java.util.Calendar
Calendar} object and set it to the {@link java.util.Date Date} from the
JobHoldUntil attribute.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; Although IPP supports a "job-hold-until" attribute
specified as a keyword, IPP does not at this time support a "job-hold-until"
attribute specified as a date and time. However, the date and time can be
converted to one of the standard IPP keywords with some loss of precision;
for example, a JobHoldUntil value with today's date and 9:00pm local time
might be converted to the standard IPP keyword "night". The category name
returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
