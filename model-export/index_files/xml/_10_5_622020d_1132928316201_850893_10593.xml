status of one of the voices produced by a {@link Synthesizer}.
&lt;p&gt;
MIDI synthesizers are generally capable of producing some maximum number of
simultaneous notes, also referred to as voices.  A voice is a stream
of successive single notes, and the process of assigning incoming MIDI notes to
specific voices is known as voice allocation.
However, the voice-allocation algorithm and the contents of each voice are
normally internal to a MIDI synthesizer and hidden from outside view.  One can, of
course, learn from MIDI messages which notes the synthesizer is playing, and
one might be able deduce something about the assignment of notes to voices.
But MIDI itself does not provide a means to report which notes a
synthesizer has assigned to which voice, nor even to report how many voices
the synthesizer is capable of synthesizing.
&lt;p&gt;
In Java Sound, however, a
&lt;code&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/code&gt; class can expose the contents of its voices through its
{@link Synthesizer#getVoiceStatus() getVoiceStatus()} method.
This behavior is recommended but optional;
synthesizers that don't expose their voice allocation simply return a
zero-length array. A &lt;code&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/code&gt; that does report its voice status
should maintain this information at
all times for all of its voices, whether they are currently sounding or
not.  In other words, a given type of &lt;code&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/code&gt; always has a fixed
number of voices, equal to the maximum number of simultaneous notes it is
capable of sounding.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;A NAME="description_of_active"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
If the voice is not currently processing a MIDI note, it
is considered inactive.  A voice is inactive when it has
been given no note-on commands, or when every note-on command received has
been terminated by a corresponding note-off (or by an "all notes off"
message).  For example, this happens when a synthesizer capable of playing 16
simultaneous notes is told to play a four-note chord; only
four voices are active in this case (assuming no earlier notes are still playing).
Usually, a voice whose status is reported as active is producing audible sound, but this
is not always true; it depends on the details of the instrument (that
is, the synthesis algorithm) and how long the note has been going on.
For example, a voice may be synthesizing the sound of a single hand-clap.  Because
this sound dies away so quickly, it may become inaudible before a note-off
message is received.  In such a situation, the voice is still considered active
even though no sound is currently being produced.
&lt;p&gt;
Besides its active or inactive status, the &lt;code&gt;VoiceStatus&lt;/code&gt; class
provides fields that reveal the voice's current MIDI channel, bank and
program number, MIDI note number, and MIDI volume.  All of these can
change during the course of a voice.  While the voice is inactive, each
of these fields has an unspecified value, so you should check the active
field first.
