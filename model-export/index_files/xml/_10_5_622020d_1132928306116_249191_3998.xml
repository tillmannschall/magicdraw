in an image.  All image data is expressed as a collection of pixels.
Each pixel consists of a number of samples. A sample is a datum
for one band of an image and a band consists of all samples of a
particular type in an image.  For example, a pixel might contain
three samples representing its red, green and blue components.
There are three bands in the image containing this pixel.  One band
consists of all the red samples from all pixels in the
image.  The second band consists of all the green samples and
the remaining band consists of all of the blue samples.  The pixel
can be stored in various formats.  For example, all samples from
a particular band can be stored contiguously or all samples from a
single pixel can be stored contiguously.
&lt;p&gt;
Subclasses of SampleModel specify the types of samples they can
represent (e.g. unsigned 8-bit byte, signed 16-bit short, etc.)
and may specify how the samples are organized in memory.
In the Java 2D(tm) API, built-in image processing operators may
not operate on all possible sample types, but generally will work
for unsigned integral samples of 16 bits or less.  Some operators
support a wider variety of sample types.
&lt;p&gt;
A collection of pixels is represented as a Raster, which consists of
a DataBuffer and a SampleModel.  The SampleModel allows access to
samples in the DataBuffer and may provide low-level information that
a programmer can use to directly manipulate samples and pixels in the
DataBuffer.
&lt;p&gt;
This class is generally a fall back method for dealing with
images.  More efficient code will cast the SampleModel to the
appropriate subclass and extract the information needed to directly
manipulate pixels in the DataBuffer.
