This
implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
&lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; values and the &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; key.  (The &lt;tt&gt;HashMap&lt;/tt&gt;
class is roughly equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;Hashtable&lt;/tt&gt;, except that it is
unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
will remain constant over time.

&lt;p&gt;This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
operations (&lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;put&lt;/tt&gt;), assuming the hash function
disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
&lt;tt&gt;HashMap&lt;/tt&gt; instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
important.

&lt;p&gt;An instance of &lt;tt&gt;HashMap&lt;/tt&gt; has two parameters that affect its
performance: &lt;i&gt;initial capacity&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;load factor&lt;/i&gt;.  The
&lt;i&gt;capacity&lt;/i&gt; is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
&lt;i&gt;load factor&lt;/i&gt; is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
current capacity, the capacity is roughly doubled by calling the
&lt;tt&gt;rehash&lt;/tt&gt; method.

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff
between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead
but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of the operations of the
&lt;tt&gt;HashMap&lt;/tt&gt; class, including &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;put&lt;/tt&gt;).  The
expected number of entries in the map and its load factor should be taken
into account when setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the
number of &lt;tt&gt;rehash&lt;/tt&gt; operations.  If the initial capacity is greater
than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no
&lt;tt&gt;rehash&lt;/tt&gt; operations will ever occur.

&lt;p&gt;If many mappings are to be stored in a &lt;tt&gt;HashMap&lt;/tt&gt; instance,
creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow the mappings to
be stored more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as
needed to grow the table.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note that this implementation is not synchronized.&lt;/b&gt; If multiple
threads access this map concurrently, and at least one of the threads
modifies the map structurally, it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be synchronized externally.
(A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or
more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an
instance already contains is not a structural modification.)  This is
typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the map.  If no such object exists, the map should be
"wrapped" using the &lt;tt&gt;Collections.synchronizedMap&lt;/tt&gt; method.  This is
best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to
the map: &lt;pre&gt; Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
are &lt;i&gt;fail-fast&lt;/i&gt;: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
&lt;tt&gt;remove&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt; methods, the iterator will throw a
&lt;tt&gt;ConcurrentModificationException&lt;/tt&gt;.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
future.

&lt;p&gt;Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
throw &lt;tt&gt;ConcurrentModificationException&lt;/tt&gt; on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness: &lt;i&gt;the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.&lt;/i&gt;
