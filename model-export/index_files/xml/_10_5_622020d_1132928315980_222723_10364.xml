graphical user dialog for browsing print services looked up through the Java
Print Service API.
&lt;p&gt;
The dialogs follow a standard pattern of acting as a continue/cancel option
for a user as well as allowing the user to select the print service to use
and specify choices such as paper size and number of copies.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The dialogs are designed to work with pluggable print services though the
public APIs of those print services.
&lt;p&gt;
If a print service provides any vendor extensions these may be made
accessible to the user through a vendor supplied tab panel Component.
Such a vendor extension is encouraged to use Swing! and to support its
accessibility APIs.
The vendor extensions should return the settings as part of the
AttributeSet.
Applications which want to preserve the user settings should use those
settings to specify the print job.
Note that this class is not referenced by any other part of the Java
Print Service and may not be included in profiles which cannot depend
on the presence of the AWT packages.
