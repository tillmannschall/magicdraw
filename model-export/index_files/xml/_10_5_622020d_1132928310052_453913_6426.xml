array.  This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).  The
&lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt; of the queue is that element that has been on the
queue the longest time.  The &lt;em&gt;tail&lt;/em&gt; of the queue is that
element that has been on the queue the shortest time. New elements
are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.

&lt;p&gt;This is a classic "bounded buffer", in which a
fixed-sized array holds elements inserted by producers and
extracted by consumers.  Once created, the capacity cannot be
increased.  Attempts to put an element to a full queue will
result in the put operation blocking; attempts to retrieve an
element from an empty queue will similarly block.

&lt;p&gt; This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
to &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; grants threads access in FIFO order. Fairness
generally decreases throughput but reduces variability and avoids
starvation.

&lt;p&gt;This class and its iterator implement all of the
&lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
Iterator} interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;This class is a member of the
&lt;a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html"&gt;
Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
