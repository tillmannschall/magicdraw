specifies the total size in number of impressions of the document(s) being
submitted. An "impression" is the image (possibly many print-stream pages in
different configurations) imposed onto a single media page.
&lt;P&gt;
The JobImpressions attribute describes the size of the job. This attribute is
not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful routing and
scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute the
JobImpressions attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print Request.
Even if the client does supply a value for the JobImpressions attribute in
the Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if the printer
is able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client supplied
value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for the
JobImpressions attribute either right at job submission time or at any later
point in time.
&lt;P&gt;
As with {@link JobKOctets JobKOctets}, the JobImpressions value must not
include the multiplicative factors contributed by the number of copies
specified by the {@link Copies Copies} attribute, independent of whether the
device can process multiple copies without making multiple passes over the
job or document data and independent of whether the output is collated or
not. Thus the value is independent of the implementation and reflects the
size of the document(s) measured in impressions independent of the number of
copies.
&lt;P&gt;
As with {@link JobKOctets JobKOctets}, the JobImpressions value must also not
include the multiplicative factor due to a copies instruction embedded in the
document data. If the document data actually includes replications of the
document data, this value will include such replication. In other words, this
value is always the number of impressions in the source document data, rather
than a measure of the number of impressions to be produced by the job.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
name.
