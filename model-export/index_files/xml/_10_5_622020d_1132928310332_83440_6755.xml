system or application component.  Loggers are normally named,
using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace.  Logger names
can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on
the package name or class name of the logged component, such
as java.net or javax.swing.  In addition it is possible to create
"anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace.
&lt;p&gt;
Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger
factory methods.  These will either create a new Logger or
return a suitable existing Logger.
&lt;p&gt;
Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler
objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of
destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc.
&lt;p&gt;
Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its
nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace.
&lt;p&gt;
Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it.  This reflects
a minimum Level that this logger cares about.  If a Logger's
level is set to &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, then its effective level is inherited
from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its
parent, and so on up the tree.
&lt;p&gt;
The log level can be configured based on the properties from the
logging configuration file, as described in the description
of the LogManager class.  However it may also be dynamically changed
by calls on the Logger.setLevel method.  If a logger's level is
changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
logger that has &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; as its level will inherit its
effective level from its parent.
&lt;p&gt;
On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g. SEVERE or FINE) against the
effective log level of the logger.  If the request level is
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.
&lt;p&gt;
After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
a LogRecord to describe the logging message.  It will then call a
Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
record should be published.  If that passes it will then publish
the LogRecord to its output Handlers.  By default, loggers also
publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.
&lt;p&gt;
Each Logger may have a ResourceBundle name associated with it.
The named bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
If a Logger does not have its own ResourceBundle name, then
it will inherit the ResourceBundle name from its parent,
recursively up the tree.
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument.  This
msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization
ResourceBundle and if the ResourceBundle has a mapping for the msg
string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
Otherwise the original msg string is used.  Typically, formatters use
java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
as strings.
&lt;p&gt;
When mapping ResourceBundle names to ResourceBundles, the Logger
will first try to use the Thread's ContextClassLoader.  If that
is null it will try the SystemClassLoader instead.  As a temporary
transition feature in the initial implementation, if the Logger is
unable to locate a ResourceBundle from the ContextClassLoader or
SystemClassLoader the Logger will also search up the class stack
and use successive calling ClassLoaders to try to locate a ResourceBundle.
(This call stack search is to allow containers to transition to
using ContextClassLoaders and is likely to be removed in future
versions.)
&lt;p&gt;
Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.
&lt;p&gt;
Note that formatting need not occur synchronously.  It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.
&lt;p&gt;
The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle name for use in localizing the log message.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level.  These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.
&lt;P&gt;
All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Subclassing Information:&lt;/b&gt; Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace.  Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance.  Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.
