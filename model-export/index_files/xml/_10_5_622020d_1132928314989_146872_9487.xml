represent simple relations (only roles, no properties or methods), with an
unlimited number of roles, of any relation type. As internal representation,
it is not exposed to the user.
&lt;P&gt;RelationSupport class conforms to the design patterns of standard MBean. So
the user can decide to instantiate a RelationSupport object himself as
a MBean (as it follows the MBean design patterns), to register it in the
MBean Server, and then to add it in the Relation Service.
&lt;P&gt;The user can also, when creating his own MBean relation class, have it
extending RelationSupport, to retrieve the implementations of required
interfaces (see below).
&lt;P&gt;It is also possible to have in a user relation MBean class a member
being a RelationSupport object, and to implement the required interfaces by
delegating all to this member.
&lt;P&gt; RelationSupport implements the Relation interface (to be handled by the
Relation Service).
&lt;P&gt;It implements also the MBeanRegistration interface to be able to retrieve
the MBean Server where it is registered (if registered as a MBean) to access
to its Relation Service.
