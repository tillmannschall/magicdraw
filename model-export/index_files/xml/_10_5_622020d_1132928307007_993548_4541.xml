provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.

&lt;p&gt; The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be accepted.
The default is large enough for most purposes.

&lt;p&gt; A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion of
line separator as defined by the system property &lt;tt&gt;line.separator&lt;/tt&gt;.
Not all platforms use the newline character ('\n') to terminate lines.
Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to
writing a newline character directly.

&lt;p&gt; In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying
character or byte stream.  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable
to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be
costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,

&lt;pre&gt;
PrintWriter out
= new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("foo.out")));
&lt;/pre&gt;

will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without buffering, each
invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into
bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very
inefficient.
