A Raster
encapsulates a DataBuffer that stores the sample values and a
SampleModel that describes how to locate a given sample value in a
DataBuffer.
&lt;p&gt;
A Raster defines values for pixels occupying a particular
rectangular area of the plane, not necessarily including (0, 0).
The rectangle, known as the Raster's bounding rectangle and
available by means of the getBounds method, is defined by minX,
minY, width, and height values.  The minX and minY values define
the coordinate of the upper left corner of the Raster.  References
to pixels outside of the bounding rectangle may result in an
exception being thrown, or may result in references to unintended
elements of the Raster's associated DataBuffer.  It is the user's
responsibility to avoid accessing such pixels.
&lt;p&gt;
A SampleModel describes how samples of a Raster
are stored in the primitive array elements of a DataBuffer.
Samples may be stored one per data element, as in a
PixelInterleavedSampleModel or BandedSampleModel, or packed several to
an element, as in a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel or
MultiPixelPackedSampleModel.  The SampleModel is also
controls whether samples are sign extended, allowing unsigned
data to be stored in signed Java data types such as byte, short, and
int.
&lt;p&gt;
Although a Raster may live anywhere in the plane, a SampleModel
makes use of a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0).  A
Raster therefore contains a translation factor that allows pixel
locations to be mapped between the Raster's coordinate system and
that of the SampleModel.  The translation from the SampleModel
coordinate system to that of the Raster may be obtained by the
getSampleModelTranslateX and getSampleModelTranslateY methods.
&lt;p&gt;
A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either by
explicit construction or by the use of the createChild and
createTranslatedChild methods.  Rasters created by these methods
can return a reference to the Raster they were created from by
means of the getParent method.  For a Raster that was not
constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild or
createChild, getParent will return null.
&lt;p&gt;
The createTranslatedChild method returns a new Raster that
shares all of the data of the current Raster, but occupies a
bounding rectangle of the same width and height but with a
different starting point.  For example, if the parent Raster
occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the translated
Raster was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of the
parent and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in
the DataBuffer shared by the two Rasters.  In the first case, (-10,
-10) should be added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the
corresponding SampleModel coordinate, and in the second case (-50,
-50) should be added.
&lt;p&gt;
The translation between a parent and child Raster may be
determined by subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and
sampleModelTranslateY values from those of the parent.
&lt;p&gt;
The createChild method may be used to create a new Raster
occupying only a subset of its parent's bounding rectangle
(with the same or a translated coordinate system) or
with a subset of the bands of its parent.
&lt;p&gt;
All constructors are protected.  The correct way to create a
Raster is to use one of the static create methods defined in this
class.  These methods create instances of Raster that use the
standard Interleaved, Banded, and Packed SampleModels and that may
be processed more efficiently than a Raster created by combining
an externally generated SampleModel and DataBuffer.
