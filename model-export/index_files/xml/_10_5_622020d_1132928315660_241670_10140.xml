specifies the total number of print data octets processed so far in K octets,
i.e., in units of 1024 octets. The value must be rounded up, so that a job
between 1 and 1024 octets inclusive must be indicated as being 1K octets,
1025 to 2048 inclusive must be 2K, etc. For a multidoc print job (a job with
multiple documents), the JobKOctetsProcessed value is computed by adding up
the individual documents' number of octets processed so far, then rounding up
to the next K octets value.
&lt;P&gt;
The JobKOctetsProcessed attribute describes the progress of the job. This
attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the JobKOctetsProcessed value
for a job that has not started processing must be 0. When the job's {@link
JobState JobState} is PROCESSING or PROCESSING_STOPPED, the
JobKOctetsProcessed value is intended to increase as the job is processed; it
indicates the amount of the job that has been processed at the time the Print
Job's attribute set is queried or at the time a print job event is reported.
When the job enters the COMPLETED, CANCELED, or ABORTED states, the
JobKOctetsProcessed value is the final value for the job.
&lt;P&gt;
For implementations where multiple copies are produced by the interpreter
with only a single pass over the data, the final value of the
JobKOctetsProcessed attribute must be equal to the value of the {@link
JobKOctets JobKOctets} attribute. For implementations where multiple copies
are produced by the interpreter by processing the data for each copy, the
final value must be a multiple of the value of the {@link JobKOctets
JobKOctets} attribute.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
name.
