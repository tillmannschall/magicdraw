structure.
For examples of using default mutable tree nodes, see
&lt;a
href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/tree.html"&gt;How to Use Trees&lt;/a&gt;
in &lt;em&gt;The Java Tutorial.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

A tree node may have at most one parent and 0 or more children.
&lt;code&gt;DefaultMutableTreeNode&lt;/code&gt; provides operations for examining and modifying a
node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that
the node is a part of.  A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be
reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to
parents and children.  A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a
node with no children is a leaf.  A tree may consist of many subtrees,
each node acting as the root for its own subtree.
&lt;p&gt;
This class provides enumerations for efficiently traversing a tree or
subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes.
A &lt;code&gt;DefaultMutableTreeNode&lt;/code&gt; may also hold a reference to a user object, the
use of which is left to the user.  Asking a &lt;code&gt;DefaultMutableTreeNode&lt;/code&gt; for its
string representation with &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; returns the string
representation of its user object.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is not a thread safe class.&lt;/b&gt;If you intend to use
a DefaultMutableTreeNode (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you
need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is
synchronizing on the root node of a tree.
&lt;p&gt;
While DefaultMutableTreeNode implements the MutableTreeNode interface and
will allow you to add in any implementation of MutableTreeNode not all
of the methods in DefaultMutableTreeNode will be applicable to all
MutableTreeNodes implementations. Especially with some of the enumerations
that are provided, using some of these methods assumes the
DefaultMutableTreeNode contains only DefaultMutableNode instances. All
of the TreeNode/MutableTreeNode methods will behave as defined no
matter what implementations are added.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;TM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
