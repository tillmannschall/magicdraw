credentials necessary to access those services. There is a one to
one mapping of a service principal and the credentials necessary
to access the service. Therefore granting access to a service
principal implicitly grants access to the credential necessary to
establish a security context with the service principal. This
applies regardless of whether the credentials are in a cache
or acquired via an exchange with the KDC. The credential can
be either a ticket granting ticket, a service ticket or a secret
key from a key table.
&lt;p&gt;
A ServicePermission contains a service principal name and
a list of actions which specify the context the credential can be
used within.
&lt;p&gt;
The service principal name is the canonical name of the
&lt;code&gt;KereberosPrincipal&lt;/code&gt; supplying the service, that is
the KerberosPrincipal represents a Kerberos service
principal. This name is treated in a case sensitive manner.
An asterisk may appear by itself, to signify any service principal.
&lt;p&gt;
Granting this permission implies that the caller can use a cached
credential (TGT, service ticket or secret key) within the context
designated by the action. In the case of the TGT, granting this
permission also implies that the TGT can be obtained by an
Authentication Service exchange.
&lt;p&gt;
The possible actions are:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
initiate -              allow the caller to use the credential to
initiate a security context with a service
principal.

accept -                allow the caller to use the credential to
accept security context as a particular
principal.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, to specify the permission to access to the TGT to
initiate a security context the permission is constructed as follows:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
ServicePermission("krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM", "initiate");
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To obtain a service ticket to initiate a context with the "host"
service the permission is constructed as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
ServicePermission("host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM", "initiate");
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a Kerberized server the action is "accept". For example, the permission
necessary to access and use the secret key of the  Kerberized "host"
service (telnet and the likes)  would be constructed as follows:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
ServicePermission("host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM", "accept");
&lt;/pre&gt;
