targeting and dispatching of all KeyEvents. KeyEventDispatchers registered
with the current KeyboardFocusManager will receive KeyEvents before they are
dispatched to their targets, allowing each KeyEventDispatcher to retarget
the event, consume it, dispatch the event itself, or make other changes.
&lt;p&gt;
Note that KeyboardFocusManager itself implements KeyEventDispatcher. By
default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will be the sink for all KeyEvents
not dispatched by the registered KeyEventDispatchers. The current
KeyboardFocusManager cannot be completely deregistered as a
KeyEventDispatcher. However, if a KeyEventDispatcher reports that it
dispatched the KeyEvent, regardless of whether it actually did so, the
KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the
KeyEvent. (While it is possible for client code to register the current
KeyboardFocusManager as a KeyEventDispatcher one or more times, this is
usually unnecessary and not recommended.)
