about the justification properties of a glyph.  A glyph is the visual
representation of one or more characters.  Many different glyphs can
be used to represent a single character or combination of characters.
The four justification properties represented by
&lt;code&gt;GlyphJustificationInfo&lt;/code&gt; are weight, priority, absorb and
limit.
&lt;p&gt;
Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph in the line.  Generally it is
proportional to the size of the font.  Glyphs with larger weight are
allocated a correspondingly larger amount of the change in space.
&lt;p&gt;
Priority determines the justification phase in which this glyph is used.
All glyphs of the same priority are examined before glyphs of the next
priority.  If all the change in space can be allocated to these glyphs
without exceeding their limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not
examined. There are four priorities, kashida, whitespace, interchar,
and none.  KASHIDA is the first priority examined. NONE is the last
priority examined.
&lt;p&gt;
Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space.  Within a
given priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space.  If any of
these glyphs are present, no glyphs of later priority are examined.
&lt;p&gt;
Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which the glyph can
change. Left and right sides of the glyph can have different limits.
&lt;p&gt;
Each &lt;code&gt;GlyphJustificationInfo&lt;/code&gt; represents two sets of
metrics, which are &lt;i&gt;growing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;shrinking&lt;/i&gt;.  Growing
metrics are used when the glyphs on a line are to be
spread apart to fit a larger width.  Shrinking metrics are used when
the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a smaller width.
