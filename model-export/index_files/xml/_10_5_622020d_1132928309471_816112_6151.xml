occurs during a batch update operation.  In addition to the
information provided by {@link SQLException}, a
&lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; provides the update
counts for all commands that were executed successfully during the
batch update, that is, all commands that were executed before the error
occurred.  The order of elements in an array of update counts
corresponds to the order in which commands were added to the batch.
&lt;P&gt;
After a command in a batch update fails to execute properly
and a &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; is thrown, the driver
may or may not continue to process the remaining commands in
the batch.  If the driver continues processing after a failure,
the array returned by the method
&lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts&lt;/code&gt; will have
an element for every command in the batch rather than only
elements for the commands that executed successfully before
the error.  In the case where the driver continues processing
commands, the array element for any command
that failed is &lt;code&gt;Statement.EXECUTE_FAILED&lt;/code&gt;.
